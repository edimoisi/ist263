        I am currently a Sophomore at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology.

        The integration of technology to simplify our everyday tasks really fascinates me. Working as a full time software developer is a dream that I am constantly striving to achieve. 
        
        Away from the computer, I love to watch and play soccer. I also enjoy trading stocks and discovering companies with huge potentials. 

        Some of my skills include coding in python, cybersecurity, and video editing.
